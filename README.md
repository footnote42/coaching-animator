## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The Rugby Animation Tool follows the **Tactical Clubhouse Aesthetic**:
- **Pitch Green** (#1A3D1A) and **Tactics White** (#F8F9FA) color scheme
- Sharp corners (no rounded edges) for a professional, tactical feel
- Monospace fonts for data fields (frame counts, timecode)
- Rugby-first terminology and workflow

## 🏉 Tips for Rugby Coaches

### Creating Lineout Plays
1. Use the "Rugby Union" field
2. Add 7-8 attack players for your lineout jumpers and lifters
3. Add 2-3 defense players for opposition
4. Use cones to mark the 5m and 15m lines
5. Add the ball and assign possession to your thrower
6. Annotate with arrows to show lifting calls and throws

### Creating Backline Moves
1. Position 7 attack players across the field (halfback, flyhalf, centers, wingers, fullback)
2. Add the ball to the halfback
3. Create 3-4 frames showing the passing sequence
4. Use annotations to highlight running lines and switches
5. Adjust frame durations to match real-time play speed

### Sharing with Players
1. Export your animation as .webm
2. Share via WhatsApp, email, or your team's messaging app
3. Players can watch on any device that supports video playback
4. Consider using screen recording software to convert to MP4 for iOS devices
