## 2026-04-18 — Project Direction & Infrastructure Restore

**Supabase restored.** DB had been paused due to inactivity. Restored via dashboard — all data intact. Vercel deployment confirmed active.

**Project direction interview completed.** Key findings:
- Status: pre-launch, no external users yet
- Primary usage: desktop edit / mobile view (original plan holds)
- Dev bandwidth: a few hours per week
- Single launch blocker: mobile replay scaling (ShareViewer forces pinch-zoom)
- v1 definition: core loop working + polished landing page + basic user guide
- Mobile editor: explicitly v2

**Roadmap established** (see `docs/authority/ROADMAP.md`):
- Phase 0: Infrastructure rescue ✅ (complete this session)
- Phase 1: Mobile replay scaling fix
- Phase 2: Landing page overhaul (tactical/hand-drawn aesthetic) + inline user guide
- Phase 3: Automated UAT for core loop
- Phase 4: AI animation spike + growth

**SpecKit brownfield bootstrap completed** (earlier same day):
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md`: File Organization section updated to real feature-based architecture
- `.specify/templates/spec-template.md`: Constitutional compliance gate, frontend/API/canvas sections added
- `.specify/templates/plan-template.md`: Real tech context, actual directory structure
- `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md`: Real paths, test commands, project notes
- `docs/authority/constitution.md`: Deleted (was backup copy — `.specify/memory/constitution.md` is canonical)
- Committed and pushed: `e042afb`

**Next session prompt:**

```
You are continuing work on coaching-animator, a Next.js 14 animation tool for rugby coaching.

Infrastructure is healthy — Supabase restored, Vercel active.

The current priority is Phase 1: fix mobile replay scaling in ShareViewer.

The core problem: ShareViewer forces users to pinch-zoom because the Konva canvas doesn't
scale correctly to the mobile viewport. The position:fixed inset:0 constraint must be
preserved.

Key files:
- src/features/animation/components/ShareViewer.tsx
- The useShareCanvasSize hook (find via grep)
- Canvas components shared across /app, /replay/[id], /share/[id] — test all three

Start with: /speckit.specify "fix mobile replay scaling in ShareViewer"

Roadmap reference: docs/authority/ROADMAP.md
Tooling reference: SPECKIT.md
Pre-push gate: npm run lint && npx tsc --noEmit
